This repository contains all source code for experiments in the Visual Awareness project, where we try to visualize the volume of people traversing a corridor or a passageway, over time. A camera mounted in the passageway uses background differencing to extract silhouettes of the passers-by and projects these silhouettes, either locally or remotely, to provide some information about the trafic and flow of humans in the area.
